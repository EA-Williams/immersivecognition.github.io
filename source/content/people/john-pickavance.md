# Profile
As an undergraduate I studied Medicine at Selwyn College, Cambridge. Deciding against a medical career, I took an elective in History and Philosophy of Science, subsequently moving to China where I worked as a lecturer at Sichuan University ( 川大 ). In 2017 I completed an MSc in Psychology at Leeds Beckett University, where I investigated the effects of visual feedback on coordinated rhythmic movement dynamics with Dr Andrew Wilson.

# Research interests
I'm interested in the acquisition of motor skills as they relate more broadly to children's academic outcomes. In this way, it may be possible to identify those children who are at risk of falling behind their peers, using scalable, affordable technologies. Working with computer scientists, we are also interested in whether there are any computational or functional advantages in training an artificial intelligence to develop in a human-like way.

More broadly, I'm interested in engaging schools with science. Rather than using schools as participant pools, we aim to bring students closer to the scientific method, providing interactive lessons, workshops, and data sets. Through this approach, we hope to educate and inspire future generations of scientists from all backgrounds.
