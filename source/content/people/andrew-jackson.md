# Qualifications
BEng(Hons), PhD

# Research Interests
My PhD was undertaken in the field of Vehicle Dynamics and Control. The focused on individual wheel control of a 6x6 hybrid electric off-road vehicle incorporating traction control, anti-lock braking and direct yaw-moment control.

While I still have an interest in Vehicle Dynamics, my research interest now lies in rehabilitation robotics. Since November 2004 I have been working on the iPAM project â€“ a robotic rehabilitation system for the upper limb. Further information is available on the project website.
