# Profile
Emily is currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working on the Helping Handwriting Shine project. In this position she is responsible for training primary school teaching staff to deliver a handwriting intervention to Year 2 and 5 pupils and supporting them in their delivery. She also acts as the Lead Admin for the project's website.

Prior to her position at the University of Leeds, Emily completed her BSc, MRes, and PhD in Psychology at the University of Manchester in the time perception lab, Time Lab Manchester. Alongside her academic work, which was funded by the ESRC and a prestigious President's Doctoral Scholar award, she held the position of Widening Participation Fellow and received a Best Contribution to Society award for her extensive outreach work.

# Research interests
The outreach work I completed as a Widening Participation Fellow sparked an interest in the ways in which children's attainment can be improved. The Helping Handwriting Shine project hopes to increase the attainment of slow and effortful handwriters by making writing more automatic, thus freeing up cognitive resources which can be used to focus on the composition of the text. I hope to pursue work relating to increasing academic outcomes in the future.
While my PhD tested a specific model of time perception, I aim to broaden my research within timing and time perception, particularly in relation to sensorimotor control such as in interceptive timing.
