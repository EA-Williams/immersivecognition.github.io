# Helping Handwriting Shine

Helping Handwriting Shine focuses on improving crucial elements of fine motor skills in order to develop children’s handwriting fluency. In doing so, it aims to increase children’s capacity to develop writing composition, and to improve children’s writing attainment overall. Members of school staff are trained to deliver the programme to all Year 2 and selected Year 5 pupils. The intervention programme, designed primarily by Dr Katy Shire, consists of three 30-minute sessions per week for eight weeks, over Autumn 2018 - Spring 2019. Sessions include a selection of engaging activities and approaches to support children’s handwriting (from body position and pencil grip to letter formation and writing sentences). Training materials offer guidance on how sessions can be adapted to support pupil interest and motivation, and to mirror curriculum themes. The intervention is being evaluated as an RCT by the National Foundation for Educational Research and the project is funded by the Education Endowment Foundation.
