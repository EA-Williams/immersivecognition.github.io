# Human-Like Computing (HLC)

The Human-Like Computing (HLC) project aims to use human approaches to solve robotics problems. Humans can navigate cluttered environments, like fridges, with ease whereas robots take orders of magnitudes more time to plan and execute actions. Utilising Virtual Reality (VR), we hope to investigate what allows humans to plan these complicated movements and apply the learnings to robots.
