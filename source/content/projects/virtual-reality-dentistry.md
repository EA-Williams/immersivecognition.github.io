# Virtual Reality Dentistry

This collaborative project partners our research with the Schools of Dentistry and Engineering to develop digital dentistry solutions to enhance all aspects of dental education. The School of Dentistry in University of Leeds is among the UK leaders in digital dentistry. We use our experience and cutting-edge technology to enhance the students learning experience. Undergraduate dental students used Moog Dental Trainer which is a virtual reality dental simulator to develop essential skills such as cavity design and caries removal, endodontic access cavity preparation and crown preparation. These exercises can be used by first year students at a very early stage, in a safe environment, to develop core surgical skills. This is an exciting area of research and researchers in our group are investigating the relationship between virtual operative skill practice and student learning as well as exploring the predictive relationship between performance on virtual reality systems and sensorimotor skills.
