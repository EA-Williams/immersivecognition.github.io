The Boxed infrared Gross Kinematic Assessment Tool (BIGKAT) is an optical motion capture system, which captures the movement of infrared emitting diodes (IRED) in 3-dimensional space by triangulating images from a from a pair of infrared cameras. In comparison with other optical motion capture systems (such as Optotrak), BiGKAT is designed to be portable and low-cost, so that it can be readily used outside a laboratory setting. By attaching IRED-based markers to the forefinger and thumb, this makes it possible to track their relative movement precisely, and thereby obtain objective quantitative measures of their kinematics. During study, participants wear IRED markers on the key anatomical features while carrying out an activity e.g. Fingertapping, so kinematic measures of bradykinesis (such as changes in amplitude and rhythm of movements) can be derived.
